Dataset for an approximative Pix2pix model

This dataset was created after the moderate failure of the second CycleGAN dataset. This dataset is entirely experimental and not very diverse. 

It is composed of about 1500 approximate paired images of sunny and rainy weather, captured by the 360 camera.
The raw footage was then synchronized using Adobe Premiere Pro, by placing the sunny footage on top of the rainy one.
