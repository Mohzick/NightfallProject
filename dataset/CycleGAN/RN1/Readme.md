Dataset for a CycleGAN-type algorithm

This dataset consist of unpaired images captured by a smartphone. The process was much simpler since I didn’t have to take pictures from the same locations. This dataset is by far the biggest and highest quality, because of the smartphone’s superior image capture capabilities and the removed constraint or paired images.

This dataset is composed of about 30 000 images divided into several categories: Rain, Typhoon, Night, Day. The four categories can be used interchangeably for training, in order to convert various environmental settings.
