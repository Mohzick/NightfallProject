# NightfallProject

From Night to Day.

This project's objective is to transform a night photo into a day photo using machine learning.

## Introduction and motivations

With the help of a programmable cleaner robot and an omnidirectional camera, we will capture many pairs of the corresponding night and day-time images from the same viewpoint. By tracing along the exact same path on the floor during the day and at night, we can capture many reasonable image pairs. We need hundreds or thousands of such images.

We will convert such omnidirectional images into normal perspective images whose viewing angle is that of the RGB camera we will use for the real-time application. Then we will train the neural network, then develop a real-time image conversion system, and run the program with a wearable RGB camera.

This project could be used in many cases which a live visual is needed during the night, e.g. a safe evacuation from a fire at night...

Concerning the task divisions, Mohamed will take care of the interface and the front-end program, making it easier for a person to make use of it.

Minh will be in charge of programming the robot, capturing the omnidirectional images and converting them into normal perspective ones.

We will both work on the neural network part since it is the most complicated and
essential dimension of this project.
