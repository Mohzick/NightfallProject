# NightfallProject

**Nightfall Project**'s objective is to transform a photo (for example night to day or rainy to sunny) using machine learning.
This project was developped during a 3-months long internship at CARE Lab (Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan) by a team of two, [@Mohzick](https://github.com/Mohzick) and [@minh-n](https://github.com/minh-n).

## Introduction and motivations

This project tackles the basics of machine learning and computer vision. It is mostly a learning experience and reuses the work of Nvidia who developped the main ideas behind the Pix2Pix and CycleGAN machine learning algorithms.

Transforming Rain to Sun has several applications in automated vehicles, surveillance and even tourism/AR attractions.
Transforming Night to Day also has these applications. Both would eventually benefit from a porting to smartphones and AR glasses.

## How to run

### Prerequisites

The  coversion application can be runned as is on Linux 

standalone windows app

the code needs those libraries

```
Python 3.6
Cuda

Dataset processing

PIL and OpenCV 

```



### Machine learning 
The Pix2Pix neural network can be trained 

## Technologies used


As a part of the fourth year of our Computer Science engineering courses at Polytech Paris-Sud, we have chosen to conduct 

With the help of a programmable cleaner robot and an omnidirectional camera, we will capture many pairs of the corresponding night and day-time images from the same viewpoint. 

By tracing along the exact same path on the floor during the day and at night, we can capture many image pairs. We will need hundreds or thousands of such images.

We will convert such omnidirectional images into normal perspective images whose viewing angle is that of the RGB camera we will use for the real-time application. 

Then we will train the neural network, then develop a real-time image conversion system, and run the program with a wearable RGB camera.
